I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematical Science, Tsinghua University, China. I got my B.S. degree in Engineering Mechanics from Tsinghua University in 2023.

My research is concentrated on applying mathematical principles to solving engineering problems that matter to the society. I am particularly interested in the computational problems in deep learning, including optimization, computation acceleration and parallelization, and their applications in large language models.

I am also interested in the mathematical education of students in engineering. I'm trying to develop a new method to help students understand the mathematical principles in an engineering point of view, instead of the old-fashioned way delivered by the mathematicians.
